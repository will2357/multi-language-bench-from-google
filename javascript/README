This is the JavaScript version of the multi-language benchmark.

Note that the benchmark has been SCALED DOWN in order for it
to work on the various JS VM's. Specifically, at the very bottom
of the sources, there is a 3 deep loop nest. The dimensions of these
3 loops are different from the C++ baseline. 

Also, please note that the code uses "print" statements, which may
not work if you plan to embedd this code into a WEB page. In this case,
please replace with the equivalents.
