# This is sort of a dummy Makefile, so that all versions have one and
# also a single method to run the benchmark.
#
#
# This version only includes the sources from the C++ version.
# However, the dimensions of the C++ version are too large. To
# actually run the generated JS, the C++ benchmark needs to be reduced
# in size.
