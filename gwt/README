This is the GWT version of the multi-language benchmark. It is being
generated from the Java version the following way:

1) Generate a GWT project from eclipse. The wizard generates a super
simple client server application, hosted in respective client and 
server directories.

2) I've modified the client part and copied the Java Driver code into
the request handler, such that when you press a button on the WEB page,
the benchmark is being started.

3) I copies the support libraries into a shared directory and modified
all the package directories to reflect these changes.


Because of this setup, it is likely that the sources as they are won't
build on your system, as there are dependencies to the tools on my system.
In order to make the GWT version work, repeat step 1), inspect the changes
made in step 2) and modify your sources the same way, and then copy the
content of the shared/ directory as created in step 3.

All in all, this shouldn't take longer than a few minutes. Before debugging.


To build the project, from the gwt/ directory, start:
   ant build

Other build commands (see README.txt for details)
   ant war
   ant devmoce (starts the server)


File list:
./build.xml
  generated from Eclipse, the ant build file

./README
  this file

./README.txt
  generated from Eclipse, worth reading

./src
./src/com
./src/com/google
./src/com/google/havlak
./src/com/google/havlak/client
./src/com/google/havlak/client/Havlak.java
  this is the modified file into which I copied the Java Driver code.

./src/com/google/havlak/client/GreetingServiceAsync.java
./src/com/google/havlak/client/GreetingService.java
  these two files were generated by the Eclipse wizard.

./src/com/google/havlak/server
./src/com/google/havlak/shared
./src/com/google/havlak/shared/cfg
./src/com/google/havlak/shared/cfg/BasicBlockEdge.java

./src/com/google/havlak/shared/lsg
./src/com/google/havlak/shared/lsg/SimpleLoop.java
./src/com/google/havlak/shared/lsg/LSG.java
  All these files were copied from the Java version of the benchmark,
  but the package directives were modified to make this work in this
  setting.

./src/com/google/havlak/shared/FieldVerifier.java
  I think this is generated by the Eclipse program wizard as well for the
  original, simple client/server app.

./src/com/google/havlak/Havlak.gwt.xml
  Also, generated by Eclipse.
